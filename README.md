# CML-Performance-study-of-NN
In this report, we will be covering performance measures of Machine Learning scripts using a profiler. The 2 main metrics to measure are the time complexity via number of flops and space complexity via memory. We will be using Nvidia NCU to verify if our calculation for the flops via pen and paper is indicative of the true flops computed on the system for 1 epoch in a 2D convolution layer. Similarly, we will use PyTorch profiler to verify if the memory we calculated is indicative of the true memory used by the system. 

Using PyTorch profiler, we will extract logs for our Machine Learning job which we will further analyze in Tensorboard. We will write a python Machine Learning script which will run on the MNIST dataset; a dataset that has over 60,000 images of handwritten digits; and classify them into a digit from 0 to 9. There are 2 variations to our Python script; 1 for the flop calculation and one for the memory calculation i.e. NCU and PyTorch profiler.
